# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-Caixeiro-Viajante-
 
A project I did for a course during graduation, that solves a Traveling Salesman Problem for a adjacent matrix that I created, but it's totally adjustable for any other matrices. I probably will keep updating this project because I want to add some features like the ability to create new matrices in run-time.

The comments on the code are in Portuguese (pt-br), they were made just fo me to understand some key points, because it's a little messy. but if you need help, just email me at lbeneti@gmail.com for more information.
